# imposter-db

## Description

This program that acts as a proxy database, in which, any one table can be spoofed, increasing developer productivity.

Have you ever been in development and the neeeded data is in the test environment, but working with it is almost impossible because application gates are always being opened and closed? With this program, just spoof the application gate table and connect to the proxy. You can easily modify the applicatioon gates without affecting the real gates in the test environment.
